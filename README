A basic object oriented design was chosen for this project. The reason was the relationship between the various entities (user, credit card, and verifier/bank) mapped well into classes and objects.

There are three main classes.

The User class handles basic user information, including the name and has a reference to a credit card instance.

The CreditCard class handles all the internals of limits, balance, and modifying the balance

The Bank class keeps track of the users and handles the actual charging and display of the transaction summary.

The project is written in Javascript for the Node server chosen for it's easy to use file I/O and the availability of additional development modules
